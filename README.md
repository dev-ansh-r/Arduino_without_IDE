# Arduino_without_IDE

Yes, we are doing it today. In order to better understand it, we will take the difficult route.  🎓🎓  

Arduino ♾️ is a widely used platform for building electronic projects, and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the most popular way to write and upload code to an Arduino board. However, there are other ways to write Arduino code that don’t require the IDE. In this blog, we will discuss two alternative methods for writing Arduino code.

- [x] Method 1: Using Linux terminal to imitate an Arduino make file
- [x] Method 2: Using VSCode Arduino Extension
- [x] Method 3: Using Raspberry Pi with Arduino.mk
